# SoftUni-Fest
1. To set up PaySec, you need to run the most recent build or re-build the application.
2. You must run ```update-database``` in the NuGet Package Manager console to initialize the most recent migration of the database. Seeding of the database with default/test values happens automatically.
3. In the appsettings.json file, you need to add the publishable and secret API key for Stripe, to ensure payment features work. For Testing purposes, one of the test account API keys will already be inserted.
